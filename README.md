#Qml-Qt-Frameless-Window-Chrome

Custom Frameless Window component for Qt Quick (QML).
Provides full control over the title bar, window resizing, system menu, and native window behavior.

---

## Overview

This project provides a native-like window experience for Qt Quick applications with a fully custom window chrome implementation on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

It is designed as a modular and extensible solution for building custom title bars and frameless windows.

## Demo (Windows 11)

Example of how the custom window behaves on Windows 11, including native-like window movement, resizing, and system menu integration.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Support status | Notes |
|----------|---------------|------|
| Windows  | ✔ | Custom window chrome implementation (WinAPI + Qt) |
| macOS    | ✔ | Custom window chrome implementation (Cocoa (AppKit) + Qt) |
| Linux    | ✔ | Custom window chrome implementation (Qt) |

## Windows 11 Notes

Due to full custom non-client area implementation (WM_NCCALCSIZE / WM_NCHITTEST), some native Windows 11 features are not available:

- Snap Layouts on maximize button hover ❌

---

## Architecture Notes

- Architecture is designed to be extensible for future platform-specific backends
- Controller-based window management API exposed to QML

---

## Notes

This project focuses on providing full control over window chrome behavior while maintaining clean separation between platform-specific implementations.
